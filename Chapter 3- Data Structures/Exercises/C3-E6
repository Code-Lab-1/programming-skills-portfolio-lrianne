  \tDue to unforeseen situations, we are only able to accomodate a small number of guests for dinner. 
  We are sorry to inform you, that we are minimizing the number of guests to 2, and therefore we have 
  to unfortunately, cancel our invite. We are hoping for your kind understanding, and we apologize for 
  the sudden cancellation.
  \tWe are aware that you have already adjusted your schedule to be able to be with us on the aforementioned date
  and time. We have arranged a separate day for us to be able to bond over dinner, and we'll shortly
  send you this new invite, we hope you can still make time for us then. Again, we are so sorry for 
  cancelling in the last minute."""

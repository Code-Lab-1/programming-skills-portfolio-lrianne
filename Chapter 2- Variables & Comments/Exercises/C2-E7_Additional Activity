#Solution: Exercise 7: Classroom Activity
#1. Create 5 subjects variables and take marks from the user.
subject_1 = input("Enter mark in Chemistry: ")
subject_2 = input("Enter mark in Math: ")
subject_3 = input("Enter mark in History: ")
subject_4 = input("Enter mark in English: ")
subject_5 = input("Enter mark in Biology: ")

#2. calculate the total marks of the student and store those marks in a variable "mark_obtained"
mark_obtained = (float(subject_1) + float(subject_2) + float(subject_3) + float(subject_4) + float(subject_5))

#3. total_marks is equal to 500.
total_marks = 500

#4. calculate average of the marks and store it in variable "average"
average = int(mark_obtained)/5

#5. calculate percentage of the student and store it in variable "percentage"
percentage = mark_obtained/total_marks*100


#6. Print average and percentage marks of the student.#6. Print avergae and percentage marks of the student.
print("Average: " + str(average))
print("Percentage: " + str(percentage))
